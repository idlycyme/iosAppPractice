A few years ago, polio persisted in only three countries and the number of victims was steadily decreasing. However, when the Taliban issued a ban against the polio vaccination, and attacked vaccinators, Pakistan's campaign was ruined. Today families and healthcare workers are in the cross hairs of politics and bloodshed as they attempt to protect against polio. Once at the brink of eradication, the disease is again a global threat with Pakistan at the center of the spread. This documentary follows its subjects; a medical specialist, a vaccinator, a vaccination skeptic, an adult polio victim and a sick child. Through their vivid stories we are drawn in to the search for a solution to this devastating disease. Will these everyday heroes succeed and end polio, or will another young generation be at risk?","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/NKvawOuj6Pvek6AwX6flSnCa40Y=/54x77/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/19/10/11191030_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/NKvawOuj6Pvek6AwX6flSnCa40Y=/54x77/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/19/10/11191030_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/NKvawOuj6Pvek6AwX6flSnCa40Y=/54x77/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/19/10/11191030_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/NKvawOuj6Pvek6AwX6flSnCa40Y=/54x77/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/19/10/11191030_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Dr. Elias Durry","id":"771648054"},{"name":"Gulnaz Sherazi","id":"771648049"},{"name":"Zabih-Ullah","id":"771648050"},{"name":"Zubair Rabi","id":"771648055"},{"name":"Habib Masud","id":"771648051"}],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"4121958"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771399857.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/every_last_child/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771399857/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771399857/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771399857/similar.json"}},{"id":"771401232","title":"Debug","year":2015,"mpaa_rating":"Unrated","runtime":90,"release_dates":{"theater":"2015-06-12"},"ratings":{"critics_score":-1,"audience_rating":"Spilled","audience_score":31},"synopsis":"In this tale of deep space cyberhorror, six young computer hackers are sent to work on a derelict space freighter as a part of a work release program.

Inspired by the memoirs of Marc Chagall and those of his contemporaries, the film blends fact and folklore to evoke the return of the iconic Jewish artist (portrayed by Leonid Bichevin \"Cargo 200\") to his childhood home of Vitebsk. Having left behind immense success in Paris, Chagall returns to the Russian empire in 1917 in hope to marry the love of his life Bella Rosenfeld (Kristina Schneidermann); he produces copious paintings and establishes the Academy of Modern Art. A rivalry develops with abstract painter Kazimir Malevich (Anatoliy Belyy), invited to teach at the art school. As Bella rekindles a childhood friendship with military Red Commissar Naum (Semyon Shkalikov), Chagall competes for the affections of his muse and future wife. As the October Revolution sweeps across Russia, historical events intrude on personal struggles and upend the quiet provincial life in Vitebsk. Brimming with surrealistic imagery from the paintings of Chagall and Malevich (over 140 paintings were used in the film), this sumptuous melodrama marks veteran Russian filmmaker Alexander Mitta's return after a decade-long hiatus.
